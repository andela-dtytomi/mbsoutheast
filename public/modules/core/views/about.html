                       MB southeast strives for customer satisfaction.  This starts with preparation.  
                        Regional concerns, difference in architects, and many other variables can have an effect on the details for each project. Using our experiences throughout the southeast, we have compiled a detailed start up process that helps to clarify any issues that might arise during the planning and especially during installation.  
                        Clarifying issues up front helps dramatically in solving issues ahead of time instead of at the last minute, which can then cause significant delays and additional costs.  
                        We also focus on communication.  Constant communication with the Project Manager and Site Superintendent are crucial to a successful project for all parties involved.
